# Greefer

This is a go based reimplementation of the project in rss-reader/. The one major diference is that it uses local LLM systems with OpenAI compatible APIs

## What do do

Read the project in the folder rss-reader/ and reimplement in golang. The project should:
1. Have feature parity
2. Have unit tests that have 100% statement coverage (use go tools to determine coverage)
3. Use local agents (configuration via env vars, find the base url to the agent with LM_BASE_URL, optional api key with LM_API_KEY, optional model with LM_MODEL)
